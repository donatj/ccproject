This is a simple Golang library implementing the XML for the [Multiple Project Summary Reporting Standard](https://github.com/erikdoe/ccmenu/wiki/Multiple-Project-Summary-Reporting-Standard).

This is a component of [Drone CI](https://github.com/drone/drone/blob/f276bc10366a3389d460a8b8903bc5fdfbe0d6c8/model/cc.go) that I forked with the aim of having a clearer and more reusable implementation.
